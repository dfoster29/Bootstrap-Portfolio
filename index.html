        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>
          I currently have the Penguins game playing in the background while I write this bio. I suppose you could say I'm a bit of
          a hockey fan. I've played hockey most of my life. From street hockey in the driveway, to ice hockey on the frozen
          pond behind my house. I don't limit myself to just hockey these days though. I've become an avid rock climber.
          I have a membership to the local climbing gym, which I try to make trips to a few times a week. I'm big in to mountain
          biking as well as kayaking. I love spending as much time as possible outdoors. I love working with my hands and
          building things. I've got a 1974 BMW 2002tii which I'm currently in the process of restoring (well sort of). I've
          had a passion for cars as far back as I can remember. I'm currently driving a 2015 VW GTI which I've done some
          work to. I absolutely love it. There isn't much better than cruising down back roads with the windows down while
          my favorite music plays.
